Guess the Country is my first-ever game, developed when I was 14. This project holds significant personal value as it deepened my interest in game development and marked the start of my coding journey. 
Despite its simplicity and the lack of a robust menu system, the game reflects countless hours of learning and dedication, from sourcing flags to implementing core mechanics.
Unfortunately, I no longer have the original source files, as I didn’t back them up on the cloud. The only remaining version is a playable build I recovered from my OneDrive.
I apologize to anyone who might have hoped to view or modify the source code and appreciate your understanding.
In Guess the Country, a flag appears on the screen, and the player must correctly type the name of the country in the text bar to score points. 
The game includes all 196 country flags, making it a fun and educational test of geographical knowledge.

Features
Lives System: Players start with 5 lives. Incorrect answers result in a lost life, and the correct country name is displayed.
Skip Option: Players can skip up to 5 flags if they are uncertain, displaying a new flag without penalty.
Score Display: When the player runs out of lives or completes the game, the final score is displayed.
Difficulty: With all 196 country flags included, the game offers a challenging experience—so far, no one has completed it in one go!

This game may lack certain features due to my level of experience at the time, but I am proud of its completion and the dedication it reflects. 
It laid the foundation for my future in game development and represents a key milestone in my journey.
